Conjoint analysis was conducted to determine what attributes people value when it comes to buying a Smartphone. 

Data is the product of 150 participants answering 30 questions on their choices on Smartphone attributes. The analysis was conducted using the R-language package called "conjoint". The top three attributes from the “average importance of attributes” were found to be Price, Brand, and Screen Size.

Conjoint originated in mathematical psychology and was developed by marketing professor Paul E. Green at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania (source: Wikipedia).
